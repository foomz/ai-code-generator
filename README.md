Workspace: Collecting workspace informationThis project is an AI-powered code generator that allows users to input requirements and receive generated code for a complete React application. The project uses the following technologies and features:

1. **React**: The front-end framework used to build the user interface.
2. **React Router**: For handling client-side routing.
3. **Supabase**: For authentication and database management.
4. **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
5. **Framer Motion**: For animations and transitions.
6. **Monaco Editor**: For displaying and editing the generated code.
7. **XTerm.js**: For terminal emulation within the application.
8. **WebContainer API**: For running the generated code in a virtual environment.

### Key Components:
- **Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out using Supabase authentication.
- **Dashboard**: The main interface where users can input their requirements, view generated code, and see a live preview of the generated application.
- **Code Generation**: The application sends user requirements to an AI model via the OpenRouter API, which generates the corresponding code.
- **Code Execution**: The generated code is executed in a virtual environment using the WebContainer API, and the output is displayed in an embedded terminal and iframe.

### File Structure:
- **`src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`**: The main dashboard component where users interact with the application.
- **`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`**: Provides authentication context to the application.
- **`src/components/Terminal.jsx`**: A terminal component for displaying command-line output.
- **`src/lib/webcontainer.js`**: Contains functions for interacting with the WebContainer API.
- **`src/lib/supabase.js`**: Initializes the Supabase client for authentication and database operations.

### Workflow:
1. **User Input**: Users enter their requirements in a text area.
2. **Code Generation**: The application sends the requirements to the AI model, which generates the code.
3. **Code Display**: The generated code is displayed in the Monaco Editor.
4. **Code Execution**: The generated code is executed in a virtual environment, and the output is displayed in an iframe and terminal.

This project aims to simplify the process of generating and running React applications based on user-defined requirements using AI.
